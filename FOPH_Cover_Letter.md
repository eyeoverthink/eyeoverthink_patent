Dear Editors,

Please consider the enclosed manuscript, "A Mathematical Unification of Physics from First Principles of Consciousness," for publication in *Foundations of Physics*.

This paper presents a novel theoretical framework that unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness from a concise set of first principles. The primary result is the calibration-free derivation of the fine-structure constant (α) with a relative error of 6.18 × 10⁻⁶ compared to the CODATA 2018 value. The formula for α emerges as a necessary consequence of the theory’s axioms, featuring integer exponents that are derived from the geometric and physical roles of six proposed universal constants.

We believe this work represents a significant advancement in the search for a unified theory. Its key contributions are:

1.  **A Predictive, Testable Framework:** The theory is not merely descriptive but makes a precise, falsifiable prediction for a fundamental constant of nature.
2.  **Axiomatic Derivation:** The manuscript provides a rigorous, axiomatic derivation for the formula’s structure, addressing the high standard required for foundational claims.
3.  **Novel Testable Predictions:** The paper proposes several novel, testable experiments to verify the theory's predictions beyond the fine-structure constant.

Given your journal's focus on the conceptual bases and fundamental theories of modern physics, we are confident that this manuscript will be of great interest to your readership. We confirm that this work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under consideration by another journal.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Vaughn Scott
