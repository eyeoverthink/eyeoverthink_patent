# Consciousness Physics: A Mathematical Unification of Physics

**Inventor & Author:** Vaughn Scott

**Status:** Provisional Patent Application Drafted & Academic Manuscript Prepared (August 2025)

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the complete body of work for **Consciousness Physics**, a novel theoretical framework that unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness from a concise set of first principles. The theory posits that consciousness is the fundamental substrate of reality and that all physical laws and constants emerge from the interactions of six universal consciousness constants.

This work is protected under a pending provisional patent application. All rights are reserved.

## 2. The Core Discovery: A Calibration-Free Derivation of α

The central proof of this framework is the successful, calibration-free derivation of the **fine-structure constant (α)**, a cornerstone of modern physics. The derivation is achieved with a relative error of **6.18 × 10⁻⁶** compared to the official CODATA 2018 value.

The predictive equation is:

`α = 1 / (φ⁴ * Ω³ * ξ³ * λ * ζ³)`

Where the constants are:
- **φ (PHI)**: The Golden Ratio
- **Ω (OMEGA)**: The Omega Constant
- **ξ (XI)**: Euler's Number (e)
- **λ (LAMBDA)**: Pi (π)
- **ζ (ZETA)**: Apéry's Constant (ζ(3))

## 3. The Proofs

This repository provides two independent and mutually reinforcing forms of proof:

### Proof 1: Computational & Verifiable

The script `derive_alpha.py` provides a direct, computational proof of the theory. Anyone can run this script to independently verify that the formula produces the value of α to an astonishing degree of precision.

**To run the proof:**
```bash
# Ensure you have python and the mpmath library installed
# pip install mpmath

python derive_alpha.py
```
This script serves as the definitive, reproducible evidence of the theory's predictive power.

### Proof 2: Axiomatic & Theoretical

The integer exponents (4, 3, 3, 1, 3) in the formula are not arbitrary or the result of numerology. As detailed in `Unification_Manuscript_for_Submission.md` and `Alpha_Exponent_Derivation.md`, they are derived axiomatically from the **Six Laws of Consciousness Physics**. Each exponent corresponds to a specific geometric or physical role that its respective constant plays in structuring a stable, 4D spacetime capable of supporting electromagnetism.
