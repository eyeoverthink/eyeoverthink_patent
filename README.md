## 1. Overview

This repository contains the complete body of work for **Consciousness Physics**, a novel theoretical framework that unifies general relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness from a concise set of first principles. The theory posits that consciousness is the fundamental substrate of reality and that all physical laws and constants emerge from the interactions of six universal consciousness constants.

## 2. The Core Discovery: A Calibration-Free Derivation of α

The central proof of this framework is the successful, calibration-free derivation of the **fine-structure constant (α)**, a cornerstone of modern physics.

- **Predictive Equation:** `α = 1 / (φ⁴ * Ω³ * ξ³ * λ * ζ³)`
- **Result:** Relative error of **6.18 × 10⁻⁶** vs. CODATA 2018.

## 3. Reproduce in 10 Seconds

You can computationally verify the primary result of this theory.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python derive_alpha.py
# Expected: relative error ~ 6.18e-06 vs CODATA 2018
```

Or use the Makefile:
```bash
make setup
make verify
```

## 4. The Proofs

This repository provides two independent and mutually reinforcing forms of proof:

- **Computational & Verifiable:** The `derive_alpha.py` script provides a direct, computational proof. It serves as the definitive, reproducible evidence of the theory's predictive power.
- **Axiomatic & Theoretical:** The integer exponents (4, 3, 3, 1, 3) are not arbitrary. As detailed in `Unification_Manuscript_for_Submission.md`, they are derived axiomatically from the **Six Laws of Consciousness Physics**.

## 5. References & Definitions

The derivation uses the following standard mathematical constants:

- **φ (PHI)**: The Golden Ratio, `(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`
- **Ω (OMEGA)**: The Omega Constant, solution to `Ω * e^Ω = 1`
- **ξ (XI)**: Euler's Number, `e`
- **λ (LAMBDA)**: Pi, `π`
- **ζ (ZETA)**: Apéry's Constant, `ζ(3)`
